# AgriCDR-CE

This repository comprises the data collected via a self-administered online survey and used for the analysis of a deliberative choice experiment on ecosystem services provided by agricultural CDR. Additionally, pretest data as well as both pretest and main study choice experiment design and code (created using NGENE software) are to be found in this repository. The questionnaire can be found in the folder 'survey' - in original German language, but also translated into English. 

This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) via the research project 'Governing multi-scale heterogeneities to activate natural carbon sink potentials (GONASIP)'.

Contact person for this repository is Samuel Fischer (s.fischer@ufz.de).
